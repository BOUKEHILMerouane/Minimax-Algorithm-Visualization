# Minimax-Algorithm-Visualization

This Python script, utilizing the Processing library, visualizes a simplified game tree with a minimax algorithm. The game tree consists of levels, each representing different decision points, and values associated with each node. The visualization dynamically shows the decision-making process, highlighting the chosen path and associated values.

Instructions

Requirements:
Python with the Processing library installed.

Setup:
Ensure you have the Processing library installed for Python.
Run the script in a Python environment.

Usage:
Observe the minimax algorithm in action, visualized using circles and lines.
The script dynamically displays the decision-making process.
Visualization:

The script utilizes the Processing library for visualization.
Circles represent decision points, and lines connect the nodes to show the tree structure.
The script highlights the chosen path and displays the associated values.

Acknowledgments:
The minimax algorithm is implemented for educational purposes to demonstrate decision-making in a game tree.

Note:
Feel free to experiment with different tree structures, levels, and values.
